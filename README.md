This repository contains Dart code implementations and explanations for various data structures. The content is organized into weekly topics covering fundamental data structures and algorithms.

## Week 1

### Arrays
Array is a collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations.

### Strings
Strings are sequences of characters.

### Set
Set is an unordered collection of unique elements.

### LinkedList
Linked List is a linear collection of elements where each element points to the next one.

## Week 2

### Stack
Stack is a Last In, First Out (LIFO) data structure with push and pop operations.

### Queue
Queue is a First In, First Out (FIFO) data structure with enqueue and dequeue operations.

### Sorting Algorithms
- Binary Sort
- Selection Sort
- Quick Sort
- Insertion Sort
- Bubble Sort

Various problems related to these data structures are also covered.

## Week 3

### Tree
Tree is a hierarchical data structure consisting of nodes connected by edges.

### Heap
Heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that satisfies the heap property.

### Trie
Trie is an ordered tree data structure used to store a dynamic set or associative array.

### Graph
Graph is a collection of nodes with edges connecting them.

## Showcase
